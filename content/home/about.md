# Biography

Tony Moraes is an MS student at the University of Wyoming interested in the subsurface hydrology of mountainous catchments. Over 60 million people in the United States rely on mountain hydrologic process to supply freshwater and recharge aquifers. Tony's research aims to better quantify water movement using Electrical Resistivity Tomography, a non-invasive, geophysical technique.  

He graduated from the University of Georgia, working the the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory. My research at the CZO focused on understanding landscape recovery rates through geochemical analysis. With his focus in geosciences, Tony has been able to fulfill his passion for travel, participating in fieldwork all across the United States.

In my free time, I love to opt outside in anyway possible, my main passion being rock climbing. Unlike other places, you will never find lines or signs pointing to the climbing spot in Wyoming. Wyoming gives a unique experience, where you must earn your climb by trekking through rugged trails to reach the isolated outcrop. 

When it gets too cold to climb, I enjoy learning about the stock market. I have both long-term investing positions include Apple, Ali Baba, and AT&T. My short term trading is focused on commodities. The best investing advice I have to offer is to invest in yourself.
